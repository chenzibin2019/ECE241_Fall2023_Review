# Create a string/list of characters
s = 'Hello'  # Equivalent of saying s = "Hello"

# Iterate through its elements
# for c in s:
#     print(c)

# Create another string
# r = ' world'
# Concatenate strings
# print(s + r)

# String repetition
# print(s * 3)

# Since it is a list...
# Return element at position 2 (index 1)
# print(s[1])

# Get the length of a string
# print(len(s))

# slicing
# print(s[1:4])
